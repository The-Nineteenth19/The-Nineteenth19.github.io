                <b>Scripting, Programming, and Mark Up</b><br>
                I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript in high school originally though I have gone through 
                online classes to update my knowledge, then again at Saint Louis Community College to get 
                a cirtificate. Also at the college I learned C#, SQL, JQuerry, and Canvas. Recently I have 
                been working on learning Lua.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Photoshop and other Graphic Design</b><br>
                I have learned Photoshop in College, for web development and more general use. I also took a 
                class for it back in high school. I have been using other programs for graphic design for a 
                while, GIMP and Krita for 2d work. I use Onshape CAD for a Cad design software.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Other Technical Skills</b><br>
                In my work as a freelance computer technician I have developed my skills in reparing computers 
                and other electronic devices. I can fix desktops, laptops, other mobile devices, and some 
                general appliances and periferals. I have worked with printers and small periferals. In this 
                work I have honed my skills in troubleshooting, computer repair, and dealing with malware. I 
                also learned working with linux command in my work at B-Works, and more in a linux class in 
                college. I learned how to properly inspect both computers and vehicles, wich those skills can 
                be applied more broadly as an eye for detail in general.<br>
                <br>
                <b>People Skills</b><br>
                I have learned to work with people in many capacities. As a teacher, teaching people how to 
                use their computers as a freelance computer technician. As a leader, both driving a bus and 
                leading kids, also leading tabletop role-playing game groups and helping lead clubs in high 
                school. In a similar capacity to customer service as an Election Judge. And as a coworker, 
                being part of a team, both as an election judge and as a bus driver.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Organizational Skills</b><br>
                As a bus driver I had to learn how to manage my time well, as I had to make sure to reach my 
                stops on time. I had to be punctual, getting to work on time so I could reach the stops on 
                time and reach the schools on time. I also needed to follow directions really well, each rout 
                had to be followed exactly unless there was an issue. I also learned how to document issues 
                and write reports as a bus driver.<br>

            <h1 align = "center">Hobbies and Interest</h1>
            <section>
                <b>Building Computers.</b> I built my own computer from scratch, as well as every computer I 
                have owned since about 2014 including 4 full computer builds and many upgrades.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Hosting Servers mostly for gaming.</b> I prefer to run servers in the console. Modding 
                Games. I frequently install mods in games. I love customizing my gaming experience.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Playing video games.</b> The kinds of games I play include puzzle and survival games. Which 
                helps me with things such as problem solving and logic. Survival games are also good for 
                resource management. Writing. I have been writing my own fantasy setting for a book series 
                and game that I hope to complete and publish in the future.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3D Design.</b> Crafting designs in Onshape 3d CAD software for 3d printing.
                <br>
                <b>Hosting tabletop game sessions.</b> I host sessions via online programs. I run them with 
                people I put together from all over the US and sometimes even people from outside the US. These games require
                coordination and communication with people. In the scenarios that we run through we cover 
                problem solving, organizational skills, people skills, empathy skills, and political skills.
                Creating scenarios for these games have brought me to research many unusual topics including 
                cultures, religion, mythology, history, as well as many scientific principles such as medical 
                studies, geography, geology, weather, biology, and sociology.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Keeping myself updated.</b> Iâ€™m always trying to learn new things in the field of technology. 
                I keep updated on the latest changes in hardware and software.<br>
